Not quite sure what I am going to do with this blog yet. I am really liking hugo as a SSG (static site generation) tool so far.
Most likely this will contain a few odds and ends of things that I probably should document, mostly in relation to my homelab and home automation. I also need a better name then **Ewan's Blog** so will need to give that some thought. I will complete the menu bar and so on at a later date, and I am not sure I am sold on this theme.
